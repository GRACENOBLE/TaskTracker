__This is a task tracker app that performs crud operations on a json file__

The app is separated into the following files:

main.go ----> The main entry point to the app

functions.go ----> The helper functions abstracted from the user

types.go ----> This contains structs and interfaces that define the structure of the app data

go.mod ----> For managing dependencies

an optional tasks.json file that is either there or not there depending on the state of the app.

manual.md ----> containing all the commands and how to ude them
